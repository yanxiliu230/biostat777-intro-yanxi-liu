I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles with a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics. I am currently doing my PhD at Johns Hopkins University.

I have not decided my research area yet, but I am interested in genetics/genomics and multimodal data. I had experience working with electronic health records in my undergrad with Dr Loes Loohuis at UCLA. The project validated the agreement between non-research purpose hospital records and gold standard research data. I realize great potential in incorporating different types of data to uncover the nature of what is bothering us, and would love to continue working on this in my PhD.
