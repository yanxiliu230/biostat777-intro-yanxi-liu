# Background

In this section, I will be doing a short data analysis on the built-in air quality dataset in R.

```{r}
#| label: "setup"
#| include: false
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
data(airquality)
```

## Question

Our question is: does temperature affect the ozone level?

Below is a picture comparising ozone level in NYC between 2011 and 2019. Based on this, we suspect that the ozone level is related to time and temperature. So let's do more analysis

## Target Audience

The intended audience for this example analysis is anyone who wants to get a taste of the exploratory data analysis.

## Data Source and Data Description

This dataset we are using is a daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973. It contains 6 variables and 153 observations. The data were originally from the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone data) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data). This is a dataset in R that we have easy access to if anyone also wants to play with it.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's first play with the dataset and get a taste of how it looks like using `dyplr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2` package.

As stated in the dat adescription, the dataset has 153 entries and 6 variables. Above I showed the first three rows of the data.

```{r}
#| echo: true
dim(airquality)
head(airquality, 3)
```

To simplify the analysis, I will exclude the missing values.

```{r}
air <- drop_na(airquality)
```

Discarding missing variables is not always an ideal option

::: {.callout-tip title="Tip with missing data"}
Here we are using the function `drop_na()` in the `tidyr` package to drop the missing values. You can actually just use base R functions to do it. And there are many different ways to deal with missing values other than discarding them, for example fill in the median or mode, or data imputation.
:::
:::

After removing the missing values, we have 111 observations and 6 variables

```{r}
dim(air)
```

Now let's do a quick summary

```{r}
air %>% summarise(mean_ozone = mean(Ozone),
                  median_ozone = median(Ozone),
                  sd_ozone = sd(Ozone),
                  max_ozone = max(Ozone),
                  min_ozone = min(Ozone))
```

Our ozone level is a very skewed variable, with median and mean separating from each other quite a lot. Let's take a look at the histogram of how it actually is distributed

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-ozone-histogram
#| fig-cap: "We plot ozone levels in histogram form to get a better sense of the distribution"
ggplot(air, aes(x=Ozone)) + geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of Ozone Level", subtitle = "Mean and Median included") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(Ozone)),
            color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(Ozone)),
            color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1)
  
```

The blue dashed line is the mean while the red dashed line is the median of ozone level. Our dataset is very skewed.

Mean ozone from May to September is 42, median at 31, maximum at 168, and minimum at 1

```{r}
air  %>%
  select(Ozone, Month, Day)%>% 
  slice_max(Ozone, n = 3)
```

The highest Ozone occurs in August and July.

```{r}
air  %>%
  select(Ozone, Month, Day)%>% 
  slice_min(Ozone, n = 3)
```

The lowest Ozone level occurs in May

```{r}
air %>% filter(Ozone > 100)
```

There are 7 days with Ozone level higher than 100, 6 out of 7 occurs in July and August with temperature over 80 degrees.

It looks like time in the year might affect Ozone level. So let's check it out.

```{r}
air %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(mean_ozone = mean(Ozone),
            mean_temp = mean(Temp),
            sd_temp = sd(Temp),
            median_temp = median(Temp),
            max_temp = max(Temp),
            min_temp = min(Temp),
            count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_temp))
```

July has the highest mean, median, and standard deviation of temperature, but August is only a little bit behind in mean temperature. August has slightly higher mean Ozone level compared to July. May has the lowest mean Ozone and mean temperature

In scatterplots, flexibly play with color, dot size, dot shapes to add more information to the plots
:::

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-ozone-temp
#| fig-cap: "Plot of Ozone against temperature shows that there is some relationship between Ozone level and temprature. The colors correspond to month; we can see more black dots in the lower temperature and lower ozone level range, and shallower dots in the higher temperature and higher ozone level range. The blue line represents the rrend line, which is roughly linear. the gray area is 95% confidence interval"
ggplot(air, aes(x=Temp, y=Ozone)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col=Month)) + geom_smooth()+ ggtitle("Ozone level against temperature", subtitle = "colored by month")
```

::: {.column-margin}


There are some dots that look like outlier or influential points that may have a major effect on fit of linear model. Right now, we might think that a second degree polynomial is a better fit because the trend line curvea bit. But without the influential points, a linear model might be an easier and better choice.

The book Linear Models in Statistics [@model] is a good reference if we want to proceed with fitting a model for this dataset

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-ozone-solar
#| fig-cap: "There is no clear relationship between Ozone and solar radiation"
ggplot(air, aes(x=Solar.R, y=Ozone)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col=Month)) + ggtitle("Ozone level against solar radiation", subtitle = "colored by month") + xlab("Solar Radiation")
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-ozone-wind
#| fig-cap: "Ozone level and wind speed has a negative relationship. The higher the wind speed, the lower the ozone level"
ggplot(air, aes(x=Wind, y=Ozone)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col=Month))  + ggtitle("Ozone level against average wind speed", subtitle = "colored by month")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-ozone-days
#| fig-cap: "We plot ozone levels across days separated by months. There is no strong relationship between the ozone levels and the specific days in the month."
ggplot(air, aes(x=Day, y=Ozone)) + 
  geom_point()  + facet_grid(cols = vars(Month))  + ggtitle("Ozone level across days", subtitle = "grouped by month")
```

## Modelling

Based on the scatter plots, we think that there might be a linear relationship between ozone level and temperature. The simple linear regression confirms our thoughts. Temp is statistically significant with a p value < 2e-16

```{r}
lm.out <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp, data = air)
summary(lm.out)
```

But we also see that the temperature is related to month. When we adjusts for month, the temperature is still signicant, although the covariate month is not. The relationship between ozone level and month is through temperature.

```{r}
lm.out.2 <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp + Month, data = air)
summary(lm.out.2)
```
In our full model, temperature and wind are the two most statistically significant predictors, which coincides with our exploratory data analysis in the previous section

```{r}
lm.out.3 <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp + Month + Wind + Solar.R, data = air)
summary(lm.out.3)
```


# Summary

In conclusion, temperature does affect ozone level significantly. The scatter plot of ozone level against temperature shows a rough linear relationship, while the linear model confirms that this predictor is a statistically significant. We at first suspected that month relates to ozone level, but adjusting for temperature makes month not significant predictor for ozone level. Days in the month and solar radiation do not show significant linear relationship with Ozone level.
